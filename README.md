# MEME Project

The meme project is a set of repositories to capture my progress and projects in a self study of Embedded and Systems programming topics. This repo will act as indexer into the MEME repos that actually hold the content.

| Project | Description | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [MEME OS 1](https://github.com/tanner-johnson2718/MEME_OS) | A collection of scripts, kenel moduals, and user programs that build a linux using Build Root targeting Qemu. Attached debugger to linux kernel. Purpose is to provide a platform for studying the linux kernel and how to extent and modify it | Technically done, but needs some refinement and doc to make it easy to use as a future tool |
| [MEME OS 2](https://github.com/tanner-johnson2718/MEME_OS_2) | A bare bones, from scratch OS running on x86 Qemu. Purpose is to explore creating bare metal drivers and OS code, and to explore the hardware architecture of x86. | Not done and needs doc |
| [MEME OS 3](https://github.com/tanner-johnson2718/MEME_OS_3) | A report style project that covers mainly topics one would see in a 4000 level CS Class. More high level and in user land compare to 1 and 2. Goal is to master the basics of systems programming | Not done, but Doc and structure is exelent |
| [Crypto](https://github.com/tanner-johnson2718/Crypto) | Repo for explorint cryptography | Very starting point, needs some love |
